# bias-corrected-estimates-of-harbour-porpoise-bycatch-in-gillnet-fisheries
Two R scripts used for model selection and validation in the manuscript submitted to Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2023 (“Knowing the fishery to know the bycatch: bias-corrected estimates of harbour porpoise bycatch in gillnet fisheries”). The first script selects and describes the most appropriate statistical model for this analysis and shows examples for running bias-corrected predictions on aggregated data, and the second script runs tests to validate the selected model.
Scripts developed under the scope of the Horizon 2020 project, SEAwise.
